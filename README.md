# Node Bot For Whatsapp - Webhooks Zabbix Integration

## Description

This project is a modular and scalable WhatsApp bot built using `whatsapp-web.js`. The bot connects to WhatsApp via a QR code and provides functionality for handling messages and other interactions. This branch contains the 'webhook listener' functionality, that brings the capability of sending alerts from Zabbix or another monitoring system to a whatsapp number or group.

## Project Structure

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Message Handling**: Add more advanced responses, commands, and automation.
2. **Develop a REST API**: Create an Express API to allow external applications to send messages.
3. **Build a UI (Optional)**: Integrate a front-end interface for bot management.

This structure ensures flexibility for future improvements while maintaining clean and organized code. ðŸš€
